This is a small, very portable HTTP server written in C99.

It currently only can respond with "hello", but more things are coming soon.

To build & run:

$ make
$ ./srv

Then head to http://localhost:5643

Btw, you can also use the xcodeproj to build/debug it on the Mac with Xcode (Xcode 8+ required).
